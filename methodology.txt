continents were assigned tones based on a vaguely left => right reading of their order according to the autograph projection.

tones were chosen to begin with A=440 and descend by equal intervals corresponding to the whole-tone, or hexatonic scale.

europe and asia are considered one continent.

melosynth was used to covert csv to wav (with one harmonic added above the fundamental for aesthetic purposes).

africa			440.000
eurasia			403.333

north america		330.000
south america		293.333
