# continents

Audio visualization of continents I have inhabited at various points in time. 

1 year = 1 second. 

Continents were assigned to tones within an equally divided 6 part (hexatonic), or whole-tone, scale. The system used to assign continents to tones lives in the included text file.

Created using melosynth and the provided csv.
